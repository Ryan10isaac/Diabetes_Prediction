# Diabetes Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict diabetes using a dataset of medical parameters. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a predictive model using classification algorithms. The goal is to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on input features like glucose levels, BMI, and age.
